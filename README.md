# Dockerised ML API #

## Overview

This project demonstrates how a machine learning model can be deployed as a RESTful API using Python, Flask, and Docker. The application exposes a prediction endpoint that loads a pre-trained model and returns inference results via HTTP requests. The entire system is containerised to ensure consistent and reproducible execution across environments.
